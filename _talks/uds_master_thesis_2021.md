In work, we studied a locally uniformly bounded function spaces $L_{\rm uloc}^{\rm p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ and an application of the properties of these spaces to find the solutions locally uniformly bounded by a second order linear PDE. The study of partial differential equation in divergence form in the Sobolev space $H_{\rm uloc}^{\rm p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$is motivated by an important step towards the homogenization theory, especially in the resolution of the corrector problem.
