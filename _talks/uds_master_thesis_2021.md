In this present work we study a locally uniformly bounded function spaces and an application of the properties of these spaces to find the solutions locally uniformly bounded by a second order linear
The study of partial differential equation in divergence form in the Sobolev type space these spaces is motivated by an important step towards the homogenization theory, especially in the
resolution of the corrector problem.
