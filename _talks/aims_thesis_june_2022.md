According to the United Nations, one of the goals of sustainable development is the conservation of forests. Forests play a crucial role in our daily lives by supporting livelihoods, providing natural and medicinal plants, and much more. It is therefore obvious that the well-being of our forests should be one of our priorities. However, in the face of factors such as climate change and the risks of desertification, our forests are becoming increasingly vulnerable. We present here a mathematical model based on a reaction-diffusion-advection system to describe the dynamics of forest ecosystems.
