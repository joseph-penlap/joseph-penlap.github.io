The preservation of forests is one of the objectives of sustainable development. Because they provide natural and medicinal plants, sustain livelihoods, etc.., forests are essential to our daily existence. It follows that maintaining the health of our woods ought to be one of our top objectives.
Our forests are, however, under greater risk due to issues like climate change and the dangers of desertification. Here, we described the dynamics of forest ecosystems using a reaction-diffusion-advection mathematical model.
