In theoretical ecology a broad literature exists on interactions between plants and different pest species (e.g. predation, competition, etc.). These studies investigate temporal and spatial dynamics in plant-pest systems. Yet they usually describe plants in a very simple way, neglecting their physiological response or vice versa. We proposed a mechanistic model to study the complex interplay between plant and a demography pest.
