In theoretical ecology a broad literature exists on interactions between plants and different pest species (e.g. predation, competition, etc.). These studies investigate temporal and
spatial dynamics in plant-pest systems. Yet they usually describe plants in a very simple way, neglecting their physiological response. We built a model to analyse the variability of plant response to pest attacks and the complex interplay among plant features.
