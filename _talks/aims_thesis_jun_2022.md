 According to the United Nations, one of the goals of sustainable development is the conservation of forests. Forests play a crucial role in our daily lives by supporting livelihoods, providing natural and
medicinal plants, and much more. It is therefore obvious that the well-being of our forests should be one of our priorities. However, in the face of factors such as climate change and the risks of desertification,
our forests are becoming increasingly vulnerable. In the literature, several models have been developed to study their interaction in nature, taking into account environmental parameters, and describing
more or less real scenarios to assess their behavior and resilience to these factors. We present here a mathematical model based on a reaction-diffusion-advection system to describe the dynamics of forest
ecosystems. First, we analyze the reaction-diffusion-advection system in our unstructured age model with the characteristic methods and transforming the initial problem into a well-known reaction-diffusion
system. Then, the existence and stability of homogeneous and heterogeneous stationary solutions are examined to show that the forest ecosystem is capable of returning to its initial equilibrium state under
small perturbations. In addition, we present a selection of numerical simulations for an abstract forest ecosystem to study the stability of steady states, verify the impact of disturbances such as deforestation,
and to explore the effects of climate change on the dynamics of the forest ecosystem.
