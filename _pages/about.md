I am since october 2022, a PhD student in Automation, Signal and Image Processing associated in both [Macbes](https://team.inria.fr/macbes/) (Inria) and [ISA/M2P2](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/institut-sophia-agrobiotech_eng/Research-teams/M2P2) (INRAE) teams working under the supervision of [Frédéric Grognard](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Frederic.Grognard), [Valentina Baldazzi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Valentina-Baldazzi) and [Suzanne Touzeau](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/institut-sophia-agrobiotech_eng/Research-teams/M2P2/Team-members/TOUZEAU-Suzanne). My team and I develop theoretical models and experiments to improve existing or infer new plant protection methods using both mathematics and biological tools.

My thesis aims at gaining a better understanding of **differential plant susceptibility** to parasitism by **Root-Knot Nematodes** (RKN) from the *Melodoigyne spp.* family. Initially focused on the case of **plant tolerance**, the main idea is to figure out the mechanisms underlying this plant tolerance, with three selected crops (tomato, pepper, cucurbit) as case studies. I exploit methods from dynamic system modelling to build a **mechanistic mathematical model** of plant-RKN interactions that explicitly links plant physiology and pest demography, including both the effect of these pests on the crops and the effect of the plants on the pests.

I'm also interested in (but don't yet spend enough time on) biocontrol, biological control and fast-slow processes in plant growth.

In addition to research, I devote part of my time to teaching certain mathematics and computer science modules, in particular linear algebra and mathematical analysis, to undergraduate students.
