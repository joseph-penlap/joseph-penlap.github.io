I am since october 2022, a PhD student in Automation, Signal and Image Processing associated in both <a href="https://team.inria.fr/macbes/">Macbes</a> (Inria) and <a href="https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/institut-sophia-agrobiotech_eng/Research-teams/M2P2">ISA/M2P2</a> (INRAE) teams working under the supervision of <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Frederic.Grognard">Frédéric Grognard</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Valentina-Baldazzi">Valentina Baldazzi</a> and <a href="https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/institut-sophia-agrobiotech_eng/Research-teams/M2P2/Team-members/TOUZEAU-Suzanne">Suzanne Touzeau</a>. My team and I develop theoretical models and experiments to improve existing or infer new plant protection methods using both mathematics and biological tools.

<div align="justify">My thesis aims at gaining a better understanding of <b>differential plant susceptibility</b> to parasitism by <b>Root-Knot Nematodes</b> (RKN) from the <i>Melodoigyne spp.</i> family. Initially focused on the case of <b>plant tolerance</b>, the main idea is to figure out the mechanisms underlying this plant tolerance, with three selected crops (tomato, pepper, cucurbit) as case studies. I exploit methods from dynamic system modelling to build a <b>mechanistic mathematical model</b> of plant-RKN interactions that explicitly links plant physiology and pest demography, including both the effect of these pests on the crops and the effect of the plants on the pests.</div>

I'm also interested in (but don't yet spend enough time on) biocontrol, biological control and fast-slow processes in plant growth.

<div align="justify">In addition to research, I devote part of my time to teaching certain mathematics and computer science modules, namely linear algebra and mathematical analysis to undergraduate students.</div>
