## Research experiences

**Ecophysiological modeling of plant nematode interactions to understand plant tolerance (2022-ongoing)**<br>
*Advisors: Frédéric Grognard, Valentina Baldazzi, Suzanne Touzeau*<br>
A mechanistic model is built to study the complex interplay among plant physiological and architectural traits, abiotic conditions and nematode biology that affects the infection dynamics.

**Mathematical modeling of a forest environment: role of water cycle (2022)**<br>
*Advisor: Nathalie Verdière*<br>
We described the dynamics of forest ecosystems based on a reaction-diffusion-advection mathematical system.<br>
