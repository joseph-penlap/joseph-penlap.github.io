While doing my PhD, I am a temporary lecturer for a section of about 33 students in the department of mathematics at the University Côte d'Azur. 

a. **SLUMA603**: This course entitled _"Numerical approximation of functions, integrals and differential equations"_ is a course gathering theoretical and practical notions of approximation methods of differential equations for third year bachelor's students. 

b. **SPUM11**: This algebra course entitled _"Mathematical fundamentals 1- algebra"_ is structured in two parts: The first part starts with logic and sets, which are fundamental to mathematics and algebraic structure. The second part is devoted entirely to linear algebra, covering the notions of matrix and vector space. It's taught to first year bachelor' students. 

My main mission is to consolidate the knowledge of the course through tutorials with the students. In fact, my duties involve

1. revising and giving tutorials to students

2. participating in the evaluation of students' final projects
