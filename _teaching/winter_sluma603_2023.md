While doing my PhD, I am a temporary lecturer for a section of about 33 students in the department of mathematics at the University Côte d'Azur. 

"Course SLUMA603": This course entitled _"Numerical approximation of functions, integrals and differential equations"_ is a course gathering theoretical and practical notions of approximation methods of differential equations for third year bachelor's students.

My main mission is to consolidate the knowledge of the course through tutorials with the students. In fact, my duties involve
